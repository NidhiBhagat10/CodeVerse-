    <h1>UX for Web Developer</h1>

    <section class="goodOrBad">
        <h2>Good or bad UX</h2>
            <p>“The overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.”
                <br><br>
                That right there… is the dictionary definition of “User Experience” Design for digital products. In short, UX design.
                <br><br>
                There is no wonder that every product around you is designed. There is no such thing as “No Design”. They are either well designed or ill designed.
                <br><br>
                Have you ever walked up to a door tried to pull it with the handle when all it needed was a gentle push to open? The Norman Door, named after design extraordinaire 
                Don Norman, is any door that is confusing to use.</p>

    <section class="normanDoors">
        <h2>Norman doors</h2>
            <p>Their design elements visually show wrong usability signals so that special signage is needed to clarify how they work as shown in figure.
                Without a sign, a user has to wonder whether to push or pull. If one has to explain their designs, it is highly likely that it is not well done.

    <section class="kingUser">
        <h2>User is the King</h2>
            <p>As a Developer of digital products, such as websites and applications, it becomes our responsibility to ensure that the products we design entail a good experience for its users.
                <br><br>
                The competition on the online is just one tab away. We must ensure our products sustain for a longer time and the users keep using our website for their needs.
                <br><br>
                The step one of designing user friendly web interfaces is to understand where our users are coming from and what are their primary goals on a given interface. Once we understand 
                the user context, we can then take better interface level decisions as to how we want the UI elements to be situated on the interface.

    <section class ="process">
        <h2> Process of building a software  </h2>
            <p>The key to developing a user-friendly digital product is to involve users in the design process by taking their feedback.
                There are many user centric frameworks that help designers to come up with solutions to wicked problems, such as the double diamond, design thinking etc.
                <br><br>
                However, in this course, as developers, understanding the following User Centric Software Development Cycle will help you become more empathetic towards the process. Moreover,
                 it is a more practical approach implemented by many fast paced teams.
                <br><br>
                The heart of this cycle are the three iterative cycles that exist at three different stages of the life cycle as annotated 1,2 and 3.

        <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>Now that we spoke about an ideal User Centric Software Development Cycle, let us talk about how you can fit in the process better and what role you shall play in the whole process.
                <br><br>
                Ideally, the team will comprise a Product Manager, who will overlook the whole process, prioritise the tasks, and manage the timeline.
                <br><br>
                A designer or more, depending on the scope of the project. Some projects might demand User researchers, Usability Experts, Visual and UI designers separately.
                <br><br>
                And finally Engineers and Developers like you and me!</p>

            <p>
                User Researcher: Gathers and analyses the requirements
                <br>
                Product manager: Does more analysis and freezes the Requirements
                <br>
                Web Designer: Designs interfaces based on the requirements
                <br>
                Engineer: Builds the website post design

        <h2>Tracking Pattern</h2>
            <p>You are now aware what it takes to build User Friendly web products.
                <ol>
                    <li>A user centric process that takes User Feedbacks and multiple iterations.</li>
                    <li>A cross functioning team of experts.</li>
                </ol>
                Now, let us slowly move into what constitutes in a web Product with good UX.
                <br>
                Let us start with "tracking".
                <br><br>
                Fun fact! 60% of visitors spend less than 15 seconds trying to orient on the web.
                <br>
                It is thus important when we arrange the content on our website, we place the most crucial and sought after information at the
                focal points where users will be more likely to pay attention.
