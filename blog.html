            <h1>Why I failed and what i did</h1>
            <h2>Struggle was real</h2>

            <p>Struggel for being Consistent in Coding wsa for real like it was very hard for me to maintain
                consistency. Today is my 34th day of coding after I started taking it seriously, Simultaneously I am
                making this website to document my process. <br><br> Tracking your Process is must because you will
                never lose your track on your coding journey as i lost my track many times before and every time I feel
                like I am trapped in a cycle of <br><br>

                <span class="struggle-cycle">starting >> revise previous topics(that is like starting it again from
                    beginning) >> learning for some days >> lose track >> start again</span> <br><br>

                this was happening again and again and that was making me feel like may be I am not made for it, but for
                me the good thing was I never quit. I will do it again and again and try different way to be consistent
                but I fail.

            <h2>I Starting Again with more Enthusiasm</h2>

            <p>I start again, This time I decided to do it in a different way Now I revise HTML and CSS and apply it on
                my website that I have made to track my progress of DSA in Java. From where I am learning what I am
                learning I will mention everithing here. In this last 1 month I completed HTML and CSS Basic course from
                CodeChef, SQL Basics Certification course from CodeChef, Java Basic Certification course from CodeChef
                and solved more then 100 Basic Questions in CodeChef. <br><br>

                I have prior knowledge of Basics of programming like basic syntax, statements, loops(just basic), and I
                was quite familier with HTML and CSS as I told you about my struggele cycle it never let me start
                JavaScript or react I was looping over HTML and CSS from 2019(I know thats like a decade).</p>

            <h2>New beginning</h2>

            <p> So for new beginning I revised everything that I have learned in java and for that I took the CodeChef
                Certification course in Java Basics and that was really helpfull for my restart and then I selected One
                Java and One DSA playlist(playlist link are mentioned below) and also took my webdev simultaneously.
                <br><br>

                In Morning I learn new Concepts in DSA and Web Development and at evening I apply Web Dev concept in my
                website where I document the things I learned Today and on next morning i revise it. And that is how
                it is going pretty

            <h2 class="day1-heading">DATE:24 Aug 2023, I learned OOPs and CSS new Concepts </h2>

            <p class="day1-content">Today I learned about OOPs in Java OOPs stands for the Object Oriented Programming.
                OOPs are used in real life problems. The Basic building block in OOPs is Object and Classes. <b>Object is
                    like a blueprint</b> and <b>Classes are the instance of that object.</b> Like for example Car is a
                class then BMW, Audi, Swift are the instance to that class that is made from that Car blueprint. Then
                Ilearned about Polymorphism,Constructor,Encapsulation,Abstract,Interfaces,Inheritence etc.
                <br><br>

                In CSS I learned about Text-Formating, Display attribute, Position attribute, Float and Clear attribute.
                I am not writing every thing here because it will take so much time but I will Link all Videos down. Ns
                also mention all minor and major topics down.

                questions on CodeChef...</h2>
            <p class="day4-content">
                Today After the Break I felt like Revising my concepts so I opened my CodeChef Account and Revised my
                topics. There was some updates on CodeChef that made the pathe very structured like you don,t have to
                search just click on practice choose your language and that's it it will give you the path like what you
                should learn or which course you should complete after that it helps me very much in my revision.
                So, these are the Course I took today I took the basic version but If you want you can upgrade to pro
                too

            <h2 class="day5-heading"> Date: 8 sep 2023, Morning Blog...these few weeks were very hacktick </h2>
            <p class="day5-content">
                Today I am writing my blog in Morning. <br>And also I am writing my blog in morning because now days my
                health is not supporting me I was sick
                from last few days and on blood test it resulted that I got Typhoid, so I am not doing much these days
                Insted I am focusing more in revision so it will be not hecktick for me for that I am using CodeChef
                courses CodeChef have structured the course Very well for every perticular Language <br>
                <br><br>

                I just forgot how we were making the checklist..okay okay I rememberd we were using &lt;input&gt; ,
                &lt;Label&gt; tags. So I am being nice and caring to me because of my health I decide I am not doing so
                much work today I will jsut revise String, Array, Sorting and complete Hashing from Anuj Bhaiyas DSA
                playlist.

            <h2>I completed 50% of my DSA playlist..hurryy date: !8 september 2023</h2>
            <p>Today I completed half of my DAS playlist and I am very happy it is really nice feeling now I am thinking
                if compleating half path is giving this much happiness then how it will feel when I complete it all. I
                am very excited. But now before going ahead I am thinking that I will revise every topics I learned till
                now so that I will not forget it. so for next 12 days I will only focus in revision and Project. Oh I
                forgot to tell you about my project actually it's about my major project it got deleted accidently by me
                so I am making it again it was a 3D converter using marker based Augmented Reality. If you want to know
                more about AR you can see tutorial on Augmented Reality for Everyone by freeCodeCamp.org its about 11 hr
                long but I think it's good for begineers and yah ather tutorials are also available on youtube you can
                see which you like. </p>

            <h2>Being Consisten in blogging is very difficult...</h2>

            <p>Today is 23 sep 2023, blogging every day is very difficult for me like doing all your house hold work and
                then completing every task from todo list(not every task) it is very difficult to sit and write blog. so
                I decided that I will write blog once in a week like on saturday. Today is Saturday..and this is our
                blog.

                hello namaste welcome to my blog so in todays blog I will wriet what I did last weeks, It was a
                productive week so days were not productive like I just wake-up eat and sleep but overall it was
                productive week. I created 2 projects in HTML and CSS no actually 3 projects although its not that big
                but I got to learn many things and it made me more productive like I applide what I was learning and it
                was very excititing when you see your project running on your device. I am very happy that and more
                cheerfull and motivated to learn more and make better projects. I also learned using github where I
                uploaded my project. GitHub is a Verson Control software. You can use it to track your projects Status
                like how it was at beginning. for Today I'm thinking to document and design this web-site as it just
                look very bad. I will upload it on github So that I can see what changes I made today. You can also
                check this out by visiting my githut account it's on contact section and for any advice you can leave a
                comment down below in the comment section. Okay let's do it... </p>

            <h2>Completed half of my DSA series </h3>

                <p>I completed my half of DSA series on 18 sep 2023 and Today, on 28 september I completed the revision
                    of everything I
                    learned in till now But it took me 10 days I was doing my project work also so it took this much
                    time but I have decided that whatever I will study I will revise it on the other day becauseit takes
                    time. <br><br>

                    For some topics I was not able to understand from my notes It was like vanished from
                    my mind so I rewatched video while watching I remembered everything. It's a good habit to revise
                    daily so that you wont forget what you have studied before.
